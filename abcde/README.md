```
If A, B, C, D and E are all unique digits, what values would work with the following equation?

ABC,CDE Ã— 4 = EDC,CBA
```

It relies on `mir-algorithm` for the combinatorics and so makes use of `dub`.

An example of running it:

```
$ cd dprojects/abcde

$ dub build --build=release
Performing "release" build using /usr/bin/dmd for x86_64.
